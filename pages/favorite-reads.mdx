A picture is worth a thousand words. Someone else's words are worth a thousand pictures.

Here you can find my favorite words (and pictures) from someone else.

In my first year at Amazon, I saw a lot of 'what if it changes?' in discussions and code reviews.
Speculation-driven design was fatiguing, but it was easy to follow along and live with it.

This blog post popped up [on Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31472997) and it taught me that I didn't have to take everything everyone said as a universal truth.
Thanks, Chris!

Sorry, I know it's clichÃ© to put an XKCD comic on a software developer's blog. This will be the only one, I promise.

I quote this one almost daily.

This one is just a fun read, but it also pointed me towards trying bucatini for the first time.

Rachel Handler is 100% correct, Bucatini _does_ bite back.
