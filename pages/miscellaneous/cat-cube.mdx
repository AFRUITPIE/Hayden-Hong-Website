## The CSS animation

Here is my beloved cat, Mary, rotating around (thanks to Seattle's [Alley Cat Project](https://alleycatproject.org) for helping me find her ♥️):

<link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/cat.css" />
<div className="cube-container">
  <div className="cube">
    <div className="face face-front">
      <Image src="/assets/cat-cube/cat1.png" width={200} height={200} />
    </div>
    <div className="face face-right">
      <Image src="/assets/cat-cube/cat2.png" width={200} height={200} />
    </div>
    <div className="face face-left">
      <Image src="/assets/cat-cube/cat3.png" width={200} height={200} />
    </div>
    <div className="face face-top">
      <Image src="/assets/cat-cube/cat4.png" width={200} height={200} />
    </div>
    <div className="face face-bottom">
      <Image src="/assets/cat-cube/cat5.png" width={200} height={200} />
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

## Background

While reading Hacker News I found [this post titled "Spinning Diagrams with CSS"](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35646199). Based on the number of points, it seems that most hackers are unaware of the possibility of 3D CSS transformations.

This post interested me because it fits into a running joke within my team. My team's internal documentation is hosted on a framework that doesn't support importing scripts, so we have gone back and forth changing our docs to have goofy CSS-only animations like img slowly expanding or [bouncing like the old DVD logo](https://codepen.io/achristian/pen/WbzgMx). Finding that 3D transformations was possible took our running joke _to the next dimension_.
