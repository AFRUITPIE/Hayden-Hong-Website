# Bachelor of Science in Informatics

The [Information School](https://ischool.uw.edu) at the University of Washington taught me how to create software collaboratively, and wrangle data to make it useful. Some of the interesting courses I took were:

- Software Architecture and Design Patterns
- Android Development
- Server-Side Development
