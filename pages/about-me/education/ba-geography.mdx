# Bachelor of Arts in Geography

[Department of Geography](https://geography.washington.edu) at the University of Washington taught me how to source information and make meaningful inferences on incomplete data. Some of the interesting courses I took were:

- Geodemographics
- Geographies Of Environmental Justice
- Geographical Information System Data Management
