## Education

### University of Washington

My enjoyment of software started long before college, but the University of Washington helped shape me with many major challenges.

#### Bachelor of Science in Informatics

The [Information School](https://ischool.uw.edu) at the University of Washington taught me how to create software collaboratively, and wrangle data to make it useful. Some of the interesting courses I took were:
