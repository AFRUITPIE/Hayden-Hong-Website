# ðŸ‘‹ Hello!

My name is Hayden Hong (He, Him) and I am a Software Development Engineer II at Amazon and a graduate of the University of Washington.

## Work Experience

Truth be told, I'm a work to live kind of person. Regardless, my work is both a teacher for me and a place to apply my learnings from elsewhere.

### Software development engineer II @ Amazon (2020-present)

Immersed in Amazon's work environment, I've developed my professional skills as a software engineer, particularly in:

- Designing low-cost, failure-sensitive asynchronous systems
- Writing and executing system designs and implementation plans
- Mentoring new engineers

### (2019) Android developer intern @ Accolade

My internship at [Accolade](https://www.accolade.com) laid the foundation for my collaboration skills and lent valuable perspectives:

- Improving development environment reproducability
- Profiling build-time bottlenecks to improve development velocity
- Developing for low-performance devices

## Education

My enjoyment of software started long before college, but the University of Washington helped shape me with many major challenges.

### Bachelor of Science in Informatics @ University of Washington

The [Information School](https://ischool.uw.edu) at the University of Washington taught me how to create software collaboratively, and wrangle data to make it useful. Some of the interesting courses I took were:

- Software Architecture and Design Patterns
- Android Development
- Server-Side Development

### Bachelor of Arts in Geography @ University of Washington

[Department of Geography](https://geography.washington.edu) at the University of Washington taught me how to source information and make meaningful inferences on incomplete data. Some of the interesting courses I took were:

- Geodemographics
- Geographies Of Environmental Justice
- Geographical Information System Data Management
