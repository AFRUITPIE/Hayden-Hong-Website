## Outside Work

Outside the office, I'm learning to ski, I love cycling, and I'm a huge car guy.

### Skiing

I picked up skiing in the 2024/2025 season and I'm already obsessed.

### Cycling

In the summer, I'd rather be on my bike than in my car.

### Cars

I've loved cars my whole life — weekends are for car shows.
