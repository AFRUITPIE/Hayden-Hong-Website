Hey, I'm Hayden 👋

I'm a Seattle-based **Software Development Engineer II at Amazon** who loves turning complex, high-volume problems into fast, reliable experiences.
My days revolve around designing event-driven services, mentoring teammates, and finding clever ways to make both code and customers happier.

## Outside Work

Outside of work, I'm learning to ski, I'm getting faster at cycling, and
I'm an avid car enthusiast!
